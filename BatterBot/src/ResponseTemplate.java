/**
 * This class is used to store "canned" sentences and their variable 
 * substitutions. Each ResponseTemplate is also required to contain
 * a list of associated keywords, and optional additional rules,
 * that trigger this response to be selected.
 *
 *   
 * This class is made up of response string arrays, and word bucket lists
 * 
 * Here is an example of a response template:
 * "Are you feeling _______? I am feeling __________." 
 * then the response would be stored as:
 * response = {"Are you feeling ", "? I am feeling ", "."};
 * 
 * This is an example of a possible corresponding  word bucket:
 * 
 * blanks = {{"happy", "sad", "lonely", "angry", "amused", "bored"},
 * 			 {"happy", "sad", "lonely", "angry", "amused", "bored"}};
 * 
 * Where the first array corresponds to a list of words which can be used
 * to fill in the first blank in the response template, and similarly the 
 * second array is a list of words that can be used to fill in the second
 * blank in the response template.
